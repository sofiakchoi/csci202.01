                    other
                    people’s pain; and insofar as you can do that with your pain, you can be released from it, and then
                    hopefully it works the other way around too; insofar as I can tell you what it is to suffer, perhaps

                    can help you to suffer less."

                    I adore British panel & game shows. There is an abundance of free, full episodes of shows like 8 out
                    of
                    10 Cats Does Countdown, Would I Lie to You?, the Big Fat Quiz, and Taskmaster. Binging these
                    infinite
                    episodes since middle school has endowed me with an encyclopedic knowledge of c-list British
                    comedians.
                    This is my favorite season of Taskmaster, I love James Acaster.
